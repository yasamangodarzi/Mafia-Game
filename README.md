# MafiaGame
 The mafia game is actually a game between two groups, the citizens and the mafia. In addition to these two groups, we have the role of the narrator who is the leader of the game and completely neutral. The game continues in a cycle of day and night.
 When people present in the game try to recognize the Mafia and eliminate it from the game
Mafia must hide their role altogether or distract others by distracting them.
 The mafia must work well together and have the right strategy for the people who want to kill at night.
The main task of the citizens in this game is to realize the role of the Mafia in spite of all the lies they tell.
